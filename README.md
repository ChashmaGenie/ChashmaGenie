# ChashmaGenie

This repository now hosts a React-based storefront built with Vite. The previous static HTML pages are left for reference, but the recommended entry point is the `client` folder which contains the React app.

Product data lives in `client/src/data.json` and is loaded on the client side so no backend is required.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser while the dev server is running.
